Thinkin' as I count these fuckin' days (fuckin' days, bitch), ayy
Tell me if I'm lookin' better (if I'm lookin' better)
Just the other night I was playin' with this Beretta (this Beretta)
I've just been so fed up (been so fed up), ayy, ayy

My momma said I'm actin' kinda different (kinda different)
It's probably all the shit that I've
Been missin' (that I've been missin')
I don't tell nobody 'cause I don't do any bitchin' (ayy)
'Cause that's when all these niggas catch you slippin' (ayy), ayy

Hope I find the truth while I'm alive (while I'm alive)
Before I fuckin' die (before I die)
Bеfore I say goodbye (I say goodbye)
Bеfore they tell me all the shit I did was just a lie (was just a lie)
This really ain't my motherfuckin' life, ayy, ayy

Takin' out this notebook every day (okay)
Writin' down my feelings 'cause it makes me feel okay (okay, ayy)
Promised you I'd take you from the life you livin' now (ayy)
But then we hit the ground, the ground
